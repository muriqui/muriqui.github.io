title: Hello there.
excerpt: I'm Dan, a full stack web developer and DevOps engineer based in Portage, Michigan.
---

I started coding in the third grade and have been tinkering with computers all my life. After college, I spent eight years as a network engineer while also building websites as a side gig. Then I realized that I enjoyed my web work way more than my day job, so I made that my day job.

## Work

For the past nine years, I've been in charge of web development and digital strategy at [Western Michigan University](https://wmich.edu/). I get to work with all sorts of cool tech, including Drupal, Node.js, Docker, and React.

## Downtime

When I'm not working, I love to cook, rock out on my ukulele, and play D&D and a bunch of other games with my wife and daughters.

I'm also a huge fan of sumo wrestling. Seriously, it's the best.
