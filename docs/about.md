title: Hello there.
excerpt: I'm Dan, a full stack web developer based in Portage, Michigan.

I started coding in the third grade and have been tinkering with computers all my life. After college, I spent seven years as a network engineer while also building websites as a side gig. Then I realized that I enjoyed my web work way more than my day job, so I made that my day job.

## Work

For nine years, I was in charge of web development and digital strategy at [Western Michigan University](https://wmich.edu/). I got to work with all sorts of cool tech, including Drupal, Node.js, Docker, and React.

Now I'm putting those skills to good use at [CivicActions](https://civicactions.com/), where we help government better serve the public through modern web technology and accessible, human-centered design.

## Downtime

When I'm not working, I love cooking, rocking out on my ukulele or bass, and playing D&D and a bunch of other games with my wife and daughters.

I'm also a huge fan of sumo wrestling. Seriously, it's the best.
